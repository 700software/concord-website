# About Concord

Concord is a workflow server. It is the _glue_ that connects
different systems together using scenarios and plugins created by
users.

Concord can be customized to execute any workflow, but here are a
few specific examples of how Concord is used:

* Orchestrate numerous CI builds to create complex release artifacts
* Provision cloud infrastructure based on user input
* Deploy applications on POS and other hardware systems 
* Execute Ansible playbooks 
* Automatically create issues 
* Notify process-related parties via email and messaging

Find out more details in the [Concord documentation](./docs/) and in our 
[training material](./training.html).
