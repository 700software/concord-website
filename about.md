# About Concord

Concord is a workflow server. It is the _glue_ that connects
different systems together using scenarios and plugins created by
users.

Concord can be customized to execute any workflow, but here are a
few specific examples of how Concord is used:

* To provision infrastructure in a public or private cloud
* To execute Ansible playbooks and deploy applications

Find out more details in the [Concord documentation](./docs/).
