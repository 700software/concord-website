# Introduction

Concord is a workflow server. It is the "glue" that connects different systems
together using scenarios and plugins created by users.

Concord can be customized to execute any workflow, but here are a few specific
examples of how Concord is used:

* To provision infrastructure in a public or private cloud

* To execute Ansible playbooks and deploy applications

## Overview

Concord consists of three components:

1. [Concord Server](#server) provides a REST API for managing projects,
   templates and repositories. It receives and processes user requests to call
   workflow scenarios.

2. [Concord Agent](#agent) is a (remote) workflow executor. Receives scenarios
   from the server and executes them in an isolated environment.

3. [Concord Console](#console) is a web UI for managing and monitoring the
   server and its processes.

### Concord Server

The server provides several REST API endpoints for managing it's data,
they are described in a [separate document](./api).

The main purpose of the server is to receive a workflow process
definition and its dependencies from an user and execute it remotely
using the agent.

Workflow process definitions, its dependencies and supporting files
collected in a single archive file called "payload".

There are several ways to start a process:

- send a complete, self-contained ZIP archive to the server. Its
format is described in a
[separate document](./processes.html#payload-format);
- send a JSON request, containing only request parameters and a
reference to a [project](#project) or a [template](#template);
- same as **2**, but sending additional files with the request.

For methods **2** and **3**, the server will build a payload archive
itself. Those methods are particularly useful when used with projects
and templates.

### Concord Agent

The agent is a standalone Java application that receives and executes
a [payload](#payload) sent by the server.

### Concord Console 

The console is a web application for managing and monitoring the
server.

## Concord Concepts

Concord contains projects that reference repositories and which are
associated with templates that define processes.  Concord also can
associate credentials with resources and repositories referenced by a
project.  The following sections briefly introduce these concepts.

### Projects

Projects allow users to automatically create payloads by pulling files
from remote GIT repositories and applying templates.

Projects are created using the REST API or (in the near future) the UI.

*TBD*

### Templates

A Concord template is a file that contains a template for creating
new processes for a project. A template combines a set of default
properties and configuration variables that users can override, one or
more processes, a collection of forms that can be used to configure
processes, and an arbitrary collection of files that contain
references to properties.

[See also](./templates.html).

*TBD*

### Processes

A process is the execution of a workflow defined by the combination of
request data, a user's files, project templates, and the contents of a
repository.  These four components result in a specific process that
is executed and which can be inspected in the Concord Console.

An example of a process can be the provisioning of cloud
infrastructure from a Boo template or the execution of an Ansible
playbook.  A far simpler example of a process can be the execution of
a simple logging task to print "Hello World" as shown in the [Concord
Quickstart](./quickstart.html).

### Credentials

As a workflow server Concord often needs to access protected resources
such as public/private clouds and source control systems.  Concord
maintains a set of credentials that can be associated with a project's
resources.

## How it all works together

![Overview](/images/runtime-overview.png)

Here is the simplified version of how Concord and its processes work:

1. user publishes an archive containing process definitions,
   dependencies and other files using **concord-server** HTTP API;

2. **concord-runner** is added to the archive. It's an executable that
   contains the BPM engine and its supporting dependencies;

3. the updated archive is published to one of the available instances
   of **concord-agent**;

4. **concord-agent** spawns a new JVM and executes the archive;

5. logs are streamed back to **concord-server**.
