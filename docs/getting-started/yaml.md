# YAML support

Concord supports YAML as one of the formats for defining processes.

## Example

```yaml
main:
  - task: sendEmail                               # (1)
    in:
      to: me@localhost.local
      subject: Hello, Concord!
    out:
      result: operationResult
    error:
      - log: "email sending error"
  - if: ${result.ok}                              # (2)
    then:
      - reportSuccess                             # (3)
    else:
      - log: "failure :-( ${lastError.message}"
    
reportSuccess:
  - ${dbBean.updateStatus(result.id, "SUCCESS")}; # (4)
```

In this (kind of abstract) example:

- `sendEmail` task (1) is executed using two input parameters: `to` and
`subject`. The output of the task is stored in `result` variable.
- `if` expression (2) is used to either call `reportSuccess` sub-flow
(3) or to log a failure message;
- `reportSuccess` flow is calling a Java bean using the EL syntax (4).

## Process Syntax

### Entry points

Entry point is a top-level element of a document.
Concord uses entry points as a starting step of an execution.
A single YAML document can contain multiple entry points.

```yaml
main:
  - ...
  - ...

anotherEntry:
  - ...
  - ...
```

An entry point must be followed by one or more execution steps.

### Execution steps

#### Expressions

Expressions are used to invoke some 3rd-party code. All expressions
must be valid [EL 3.0](https://github.com/javaee/el-spec).

Short form:
```yaml
main:
  # calling a method
  - ${myBean.someMethod()}
  
  # calling a method with an argument
  - ${myBean.someMethod(myContextArg)}
  
  # literal values
  - ${1 + 2}
  
  # EL 3.0 extensions:
  - ${[1, 2, 3].stream().map(x -> x + 1).toList()}
```

Full form:
```yaml
main:
  - expr: ${myBean.someMethod()}
    out: myVar
    error:
      - ${log.error("something bad happened")}
```

Full form can optionally contain additional declarations:
- `out` field - contains the name of a variable, in which a result of
the expression will be stored;
- `error` block - to handle any exceptions thrown by the evaluation.
Exceptions are wrapped in `BpmnError` type.

See [the list of automatically provided variables](./processes.html#provided-variables).

Literal values (e.g. arguments or [form](#forms) field values) can
contain expressions:
```yaml
main:
  - log: ["red", "green", "${colors.blue}"]
  - myTask: { nested: { literals: "${myOtherTask.doSomething()}"} }
```

#### Tasks

There are other ways to call Java code: by using dynamic method
resolution or by using `JavaDelegate` instances.

Dynamic method resolution is the simplest way to call Java code.
Any object that implements `com.walmartlabs.concord.common.Task`
interface and provides a `call(...)` method —Åan be called this way.

```yaml
main:

  # calling a method with a single argument
  # same as $(log.call("hello")}
  - log: hello
  
  # calling a method with a single argument
  # the value will be a result of expression evaluation
  - log: ${myMessage}
  
  # calling a method with two arguments
  # same as $(log.call("warn", "hello")}
  - log: ["warn", "hello"]
  
  # calling a method with a single argument
  # the value will be converted into Map<String, Object>
  - log: { level: "warn", message: "hello" }
  
  # multiline strings and string interpolation is also supported
  - log: |
      those line breaks will be
      preserved. Here will be a ${result} of EL evaluation.
```

Alternatively, `JavaDelegate` instances can be used. While the support
for `JavaDelegate` tasks is mostly for compatibility reasons, it
provides additional features like in/out variables mapping.

```yaml
main:
  # calling a task with in/out variables mapping
  - task: myTask
    in:
      taskVar: ${processVar}
      anotherTaskVar: "a literal value"
    out:
      processVar: ${taskVar}
    error:
      - log: something bad happened
```

### Conditional expressions

```yaml
main:
  - if: ${myVar > 0}
    then:                           # (1)
      - log: it's clearly non-zero
    else:                           # (2)
      - log: zero or less

  - ${myBean.acceptValue(myVar)}    # (3)
```

In this example, after `then` (1) or `else` (2) block are completed,
the execution will continue from the next step in the flow (3).

### Return command

The `return` command can be used to stop the execution of the current
(sub) flow:

```yaml
main:
  - if: ${myVar > 0}
    then:
      - log: moving along
    else:
      - return
```

### Groups of steps

Several steps can be grouped in one block. This allows `try-catch`-like
semantic:

```yaml
main:
  - log: a step before the group
  - ::
    - log: a step inside the group
    - ${myBean.somethingDangerous()}
    error:
      - log: well, that didn't work
```

### Calling other flows

Flows, defined in the same YAML document, can be called by their names:

```yaml
main:
  - log: hello
  - mySubFlow
  - log: bye
  
mySubFlow:
  - log: a message from the sub flow
```

### Scripting

Most of the JSR-223 compatible script engines are supported:

```yaml
main:
  - script: js
    body: |
      function doSomething(i) {
        return i * 2;
      }

      var x = execution.getVariable("input");
      execution.setVariable("output", doSomething(x));
```

External scripts can also be used:
```yaml
main:
  - script: my_scripts/test.js
```

Path to a script must be relative to the root directory of a workspace.

See [the expressions](#expressions) section for the list of provided
global variables.

JavaScript content is executed using Java's Nashorn engine. All other
engines require additional dependencies to be included with the process
definition. See also the [Scripting](scripting.html) document.

### Variables

The `set` command can be used to set variables into the current
flow:

```yaml
main:
  - ...
  - set:
      a: "a-value"
      b: 3
  - log: ${a}
  - log: ${b}
```

### Docker

To start a docker container from process, use the docker command:

```yaml
main:
 - docker: 
    image: docker.prod.walmart.com/walmartlabs/concord-ansible
    cmd: ansible-playbook -h
```


## Form Syntax

### Declaring a new form

Forms are declared at the top level of a YAML document, just like the
processes. Form label format: `form ($FORM_NAME)`.

```yaml
form (myForm):
  - ...
```

The name of a form (in this example it's `myForm`) can be used to
[call a form](#calling-a-form) from a process. Also, it will be used
as a name of a map object which stores the values of the fields.

### Form fields

Forms must contain one or more fields:

```yaml
form (myForm):
  - fullName: { label: "Name", type: "string", pattern: ".* .*" }
  - age: { label: "Age", type: "int", min: 21, max: 100 }
  - favouriteColour: { label: "Favourite colour", type: "string", allow: ["gray", "grey"] }
  - languages: { label: "Preferred languages", type: "string+", allow: "${locale.languages()}" }
  - password: {label: "Password", type: "string", inputType: "password"}
```

Field declaration consists of the name (`myField`), the type
(`string`) and additional options.

The name of a field will be used to store a field's value in the
form's results. E.g. if the form's name is `myForm` and the field's
name is `myField`, then the value of the field will be stored in
`myForm.myField` variable.

Common options:
- `label`: the field's label, usually human-readable;
- `value`: default value [expression](#expressions), evaluated when
the form is called;
- `allow`: allowed value(s). Can be a YAML literal, array, object or an
[expression](#expressions).

Supported types of fields and their options:
- `string`: a string value
  - `pattern`: (optional) a regular expression to check the value.
  - `inputType`: (optional) specifies the type of html <input> element to display. 
- `int`: an integer value
  - `min`, `max`: (optional) value bounds.
- `decimal`: a decimal value
  - `min`, `max`: (optional) value bounds.
  
Cardinality of the field can be specified by adding a cardinality
quantifier to the type:
- a single non-optional value: `string`;
- optional value: `string?`;
- one or more values: `string+`;
- zero or more values: `string*`.

Additional field types will be added in the next versions.

### Calling a form

To call a form from a process, use `form` command:

```yaml
main:
  - form: myForm
  - ${log.info("test", myForm.myField)}
```

Forms will be pre-populated with values if the current context contains
a map object, stored under the form's name. E.g. if the context has
a map object

```json
{
  "myForm": {
    "myField": "my string value"
  }
}
```

then the form's `myField` will be populated with `my string value`.

The `form` command accepts additional options:
```yaml
main:
  - form: myForm
    yield: true
    values:
      myField: "a different value"
      additionalData:
        nestedField:
          aValue: 123
```

Supported options:
- `yield`: a boolean value. If `true`, the UI wizard will stop after this
form and the rest of the process will continue in "background". Supported
only for custom (with branding) forms;
- `values`: additional values, to override default form values or to
provide additional data.
