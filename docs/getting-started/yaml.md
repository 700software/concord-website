## Example

```yaml
main:
  - task: sendEmail                               # (1)
    in:
      to: me@localhost.local
      subject: Hello, Concord!
    out:
      result: operationResult
    error:
      - log: "email sending error"
  - if: ${result.ok}                              # (2)
    then:
      - reportSuccess                             # (3)
    else:
      - log: "Failed: ${lastError.message}"

reportSuccess:
  - ${dbBean.updateStatus(result.id, "SUCCESS")}; # (4)
```

In this example:
- `sendEmail` task (1) is executed using two input parameters: `to` and
`subject`. The output of the task is stored in `result` variable.
- `if` expression (2) is used to either call `reportSuccess` sub-flow
(3) or to log a failure message;
- `reportSuccess` flow is calling a Java bean using the EL syntax (4).

Note: the actual task names and their required parameters may differ.
Please refer to the specific task's documentation.

## Process Syntax

### Entry Points

Entry point is a top-level element of a document.
Concord uses entry points as a starting step of an execution.
A single YAML document can contain multiple entry points.

```yaml
main:
  - ...
  - ...

anotherEntry:
  - ...
  - ...
```

An entry point must be followed by one or more execution steps.

### Execution Steps

#### Expressions

Expressions are used to invoke some 3rd-party code. All expressions
must be valid [EL 3.0](https://github.com/javaee/el-spec).

Short form:
```yaml
main:
  # calling a method
  - ${myBean.someMethod()}

  # calling a method with an argument
  - ${myBean.someMethod(myContextArg)}

  # literal values
  - ${1 + 2}

  # EL 3.0 extensions:
  - ${[1, 2, 3].stream().map(x -> x + 1).toList()}
```

Full form:
```yaml
main:
  - expr: ${myBean.someMethod()}
    out: myVar
    error:
      - ${log.error("something bad happened")}
```

Full form can optionally contain additional declarations:
- `out` field - contains the name of a variable, in which a result of
the expression will be stored;
- `error` block - to handle any exceptions thrown by the evaluation.
Exceptions are wrapped in `BpmnError` type.

See [the list of automatically provided variables](./processes.html#provided-variables).

Literal values (e.g. arguments or [form](#forms) field values) can
contain expressions:
```yaml
main:
  - myTask: ["red", "green", "${colors.blue}"]
  - myTask: { nested: { literals: "${myOtherTask.doSomething()}"} }
```

#### Tasks

There are other ways to call Java code: by using dynamic method
resolution or by using `JavaDelegate` instances.

Dynamic method resolution is the simplest way to call Java code.
Any object that implements `com.walmartlabs.concord.common.Task`
interface and provides a `call(...)` method —Åan be called this way.

```yaml
main:

  # calling a method with a single argument
  # same as ${myTask.call("hello")}
  - myTask: hello

  # calling a method with a single argument
  # the value will be a result of expression evaluation
  - myTask: ${myMessage}

  # calling a method with two arguments
  # same as ${myTask.call("warn", "hello")}
  - myTask: ["warn", "hello"]

  # calling a method with a single argument
  # the value will be converted into Map<String, Object>
  - myTask: { "urgency": "high", message: "hello" }

  # multiline strings and string interpolation is also supported
  - myTask: |
      those line breaks will be
      preserved. Here will be a ${result} of EL evaluation.
```

If a task implements `#execute(Context)` method, some additional
features like in/out variables mapping can be used:

```yaml
main:
  # calling a task with in/out variables mapping
  - task: myTask
    in:
      taskVar: ${processVar}
      anotherTaskVar: "a literal value"
    out:
      processVar: ${taskVar}
    error:
      - log: something bad happened
```

See also the [Tasks](tasks.html) document for more details.

### Conditional Expressions

```yaml
main:
  - if: ${myVar > 0}
    then:                           # (1)
      - log: it's clearly non-zero
    else:                           # (2)
      - log: zero or less

  - ${myBean.acceptValue(myVar)}    # (3)
```

In this example, after `then` (1) or `else` (2) block are completed,
the execution will continue from the next step in the flow (3).

### Return Command

The `return` command can be used to stop the execution of the current
(sub) flow:

```yaml
main:
  - if: ${myVar > 0}
    then:
      - log: moving along
    else:
      - return
```

### Groups of Steps

Several steps can be grouped in one block. This allows `try-catch`-like
semantic:

```yaml
main:
  - log: a step before the group
  - ::
    - log: a step inside the group
    - ${myBean.somethingDangerous()}
    error:
      - log: well, that didn't work
```

### Calling Other Flows

Flows, defined in the same YAML document, can be called by their names:

```yaml
main:
  - log: hello
  - mySubFlow
  - log: bye

mySubFlow:
  - log: a message from the sub flow
```

Using input variables (call arguments) and error handling:
```yaml
main:
  - call: mySubFlow
    in:
      name: "Concord"
    error:
      - log: "Oh, no"

mySubFlow:
  - if: "${name != 'Concord'}"
    then:
      - return: strangerDanger
  - log: "Hello, ${name}"
```

Similar to [tasks](#tasks), the `in` variables can use expressions.

### Scripting

Most of the JSR-223 compatible script engines are supported:

```yaml
main:
  - script: js
    body: |
      function doSomething(i) {
        return i * 2;
      }

      var x = execution.getVariable("input");
      execution.setVariable("output", doSomething(x));
```

External scripts can also be used:
```yaml
main:
  - script: my_scripts/test.js
```

Path to a script must be relative to the root directory of a workspace.

See [the expressions](#expressions) section for the list of provided
global variables.

JavaScript content is executed using Java's Nashorn engine. All other
engines require additional dependencies to be included with the process
definition. See also the [Scripting](scripting.html) document.

### Variables

The `set` command can be used to set variables into the current
flow:

```yaml
main:
  - ...
  - set:
      a: "a-value"
      b: 3
  - log: ${a}
  - log: ${b}
```

### Docker

To start a docker container from process, use the docker command:

```yaml
main:
 - docker: docker.prod.walmart.com/walmartlabs/concord-ansible
   cmd: ansible-playbook -h
```

For more details please refer to the [Docker](docker.html) document.

Form support is described in a [separate](forms.html) document.
