# Processes

A process is the execution of a workflow defined by the combination of request data, a user's files, project templates, and the contents of a repository. These four components result in a specific process that is executed and which can be inspected in the Concord Console.

An example of a process can be the provisioning of cloud infrastructure from a OneOps Boo template or the execution of an Ansible playbook. A far simpler example of a process can be the execution of a simple logging task to print "Hello World" as shown in the [Concord Quickstart](./quickstart.html).
