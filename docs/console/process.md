A process is the execution of a workflow defined by the combination of request
data, a user's files, project templates, and the contents of a repository. These
four components result in a specific process that is executed and which can be
inspected in the Concord Console.

An simple example can be the execution of a simple logging task to print "Hello
World" as shown in the [quickstart](../getting-started/quickstart.html).

The Concord Console provides comprehensive access to process data on the Processes list
as well as in a separate view for a specific process.
